                <strong>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</strong>
                (Japanese: 銀河英雄伝説, Hepburn: Ginga Eiyū Densetsu), sometimes abbreviated as <span>LOTGH</span>, <span>LOGH</span>
                or <span>Gin'eiden</span> (銀英伝) in Japanese, is a series of science fiction novels written by Yoshiki Tanaka.

                In humanity's distant future, two interstellar states – the monarchic Galactic Empire and the democratic
                Free Planets Alliance – are embroiled in a never-ending war. The story focuses on the exploits of rivals
                Reinhard von Lohengramm and Yang Wen-li, as they rise to power and fame in the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance,
                respectively.

            <div class="text">The Galactic Empire (Japanese: 銀河帝国) was an interstellar nation which encompassed most of the human colony worlds within the galaxy. Ruled by a kaiser (or emperor), the Empire was, for much of its history, an autocratic monarchy structured around a rigid European-style feudal system. The Galactic Empire was established in 310 UC by Rudolf von Goldenbaum, the first emperor of the Goldenbaum Dynasty. Its flag was the white crest of the Goldenbaum Dynasty, a stylised crowned two headed eagle, on a black background. The seat of government was based on the planet Odin, in the Imperial palace of Neue Sanssouci. Following numerous social and political reforms after the Imperial Civil War, the Galactic Empire was eventually reorganised into the New Galactic Empire with the abdication of the last Goldenbaum ruler, Katharin Kätchen, in favour of Reinhard von Lohengramm in 799 UC.</div>

            <div class="text">The Free Planets Alliance (Japanese: 自由惑星同盟), or FPA, was a representative democracy founded by Nguyen Kim Hua in 527 UC, which eventually grew to occupy the Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, and was one of the two centres of human civilisation in the galaxy. It was ruled by a High Council, with the Supreme Chairman of this as head of state and the other members as cabinet members. Its flag was a horizontal tricolour of red, white, and blue with a depiction of a yellow pentagonal pyramid in the centre of the white stripe. Its currency was a fiat currency called the dinar (plural: dinars). The seat of government was the High Council Building in the city Heinessenpolis on the planet Heinessen. The Alliance was dissolved in 800 UC following its defeat in the Second Alliance–Imperial War.</div>
